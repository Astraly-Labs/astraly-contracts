# Development Workflow

This repository has been bootstrapped using [Nile](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

_Note: Mac and Mac M1 have special instructions you can refer to this [article](https://th0rgal.medium.com/the-easiest-way-to-setup-a-cairo-dev-environment-8f2a63610d46)_

1. Install Dependencies
   `poetry install`

2. Spin up a node (in a separate terminal window w/ the python environment running)
   `poetry run nile node`

3. Compile contracts
   `poetry run nile compile`

4. Run tests
   `poetry run pytest tests/`

5. Deploy contracts
   `poetry run nile run scripts/deploy.py`

These commands will test and deploy against your local node. If you want to deploy to the goerli testnet, use --network goerli instead.
